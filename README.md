I have scraped www.PropertyFinder.bh site.

Here I have used-
  - **`xpath`**
  - **ItemLoader**
  - scrap **next_page** data also.


This code can be modified to used for other sites 


**Advantage of using the ItemLoader**
- if we had **another similar spider to write**,  we could access the same fields in **items.py** if we chose to import that very same module.

Here I illustre the use of xpath selectors, ItemLoader and Input/Output Processors as an alternative way of Scraping a real estate site.
